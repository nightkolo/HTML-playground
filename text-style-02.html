                Ever since I finally got this MacBook, and replaced my old grandpa-like windows laptop, a lot of possibilities have been unlocked. Admittedly, I feel a bit lost in the world of software engineering, as there are countless paths to consider.

                Web development I believe is a valuable skill to obtain and master, currently I confidently know fairly basic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript is a language I haven’t touched since I believe 2023.
                <br><br>
                I’m thinking of learning HTML, then CSS, then Eventually JavaScript, from there I have all the skills needed to interact with different APIs, game development made on the web, and other imaginary nonsense I have stored in mind. Especially since I also have portfolio website that is in desperate call of a proper redesign.

                Programming Languages

            <p class="p-text-body shadow-effect">
                I believe there is also a desire to get into programming languages, beyond GDscript for Godot. I have this lingering feeling that I should expand my programming prowess. There are many languages I believe are valuable and would provide me with important lessons in my career.
                <br><br>
                Truthfully, programming languages may seem like a less exciting path to indulge in. Unlike web development, I'll most likely be building text-based applications with my obtained skills at the least.

                            <li>Here comes a language I’ve been desiring to indulge in for a while. I literally obtained a C++ Programming Book from University and began reading the 1st chapter—it's a good read. It taught very important lessons about the history of programming languages, which fascinated me. One consideration about C++ is unlike GDscript or Python, it’s quite a low level language. I would be writing code with close proximity to hardware. Additionally, C++ is not a breezy language to set up; it is difficult. As learning material, I would create simple applications with the language, even after hopefully getting a hand with the language. So this begs the question; Is C++ for me?</li>

                One of the important skills as a software engineer is understanding and using git, I believe it is high necessity in the field. Granted, I have been using git to commit, push, track my projects to Github, but I feel I’m a basic user of git, and haven’t mastered it yet.
