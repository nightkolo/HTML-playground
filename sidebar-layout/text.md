# Ramblings

These are random pieces of text I wrote for Academic English, revolving around [intrinsic and extrinsic motivation](https://www.simplypsychology.org/differences-between-extrinsic-and-intrinsic-motivation.html). The following is a direction-less webpage, emerging coincidentally from my studies.

## Simple Questions

- What is the key difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and how do they influence behavior differently?
- Can intrinsic and extrinsic motivation coexist? Provide an example of a situation where both types of motivation are present.
- Why is intrinsic motivation generally considered more sustainable for long-term success compared to extrinsic motivation?

## Answers

1. Intrinsic motivation emerges from passion and personal endeavors, extrinsic motivation emerges from outside sources
2. Yes, both motivations can be coexistent. A web developer can be intrinsically motivated as per their passion and genuine enthusiasm for the craftsmanship, while a part of them is extrinsically motivated for financial rewards and career opportunities in their respective industry
3. Intrinsically motivated individuals possess a deeply rooted passion and enthusiasm for their craft, ensuring sustainable and long-term success propelled by personal fulfillment. Extrinsic motivation contrasts this effect by removing passion and enthusiasm, leaving only external factors to determine the drive.
