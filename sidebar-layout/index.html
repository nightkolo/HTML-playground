          <p>These are random pieces of text I wrote for Academic English, revolving around <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/differences-between-extrinsic-and-intrinsic-motivation.html">intrinsic and extrinsic motivation</a>. The following is a direction-less webpage, emerging coincidentally from my studies.

            <ul>
            <li>What is the key difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and how do they influence behavior differently?</li>
            <li>Can intrinsic and extrinsic motivation coexist? Provide an example of a situation where both types of motivation are present.</li>
            <li>Why is intrinsic motivation generally considered more sustainable for long-term success compared to extrinsic motivation?</li>

            <ol>
            <li>Intrinsic motivation emerges from passion and personal endeavors, the latter of which comes from outside sources</li>
            <li>Yes, both motivations can be coexistent. A web developer can be intrinsically motivated as per their passion and genuine enthusiasm for the craftsmanship, while a part of them is extrinsically motivated for financial rewards and career opportunities in their respective industry.</li>
            <li>Intrinsically motivated individuals possess a deeply rooted passion and enthusiasm for their craft, ensuring sustainable and long-term success propelled by personal fulfillment. Extrinsic motivation contrasts this effect by removing passion and enthusiasm, leaving only external factors to determine the drive.</li>
