            <h1 id="bokoblock">BOKOBLOCK</h1>
            <p><strong>Bokoblock</strong> (stylized <strong>BOKOBLOCK</strong>) is an upcoming grid-based puzzle game I&#39;m making. Made in <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/">Godot 4.3</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="project">Project</h2>
            <p>Everything is included in the <a href="src/">src</a> directory.</p>
            <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
            <p>P.S. This repo exists as a way for me to learn git and github, and gain some experience.</p>
            <h3 id="heads-up">Heads up</h3>
            <p>The game, same with this repo, are obviously still in development. I&#39;m working on the game, tracking changes, and learning more about git. You can view the codebase so far at your pace!</p>
